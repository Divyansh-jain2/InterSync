## üß† Resume Scoring Logic (In-Depth)

The resume scorer uses a multi-step, AI-powered process to generate a comprehensive score and actionable feedback:

### 1. Semantic Similarity (Resume vs. Job Description)
- **How:**
  - The resume text and job description are both sent to Google Gemini to generate embeddings (vector representations).
  - The **cosine similarity** between these two vectors is calculated.
  - The similarity score is normalized to a 0‚Äì1 range.
- **Why:**
  - Rewards resumes that are semantically aligned with the job requirements.

### 2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **How:**
  - Gemini is prompted to extract:
    - **Roles:** Job titles found in the resume.
    - **Organizations:** Company names.
    - **Degrees:** Educational qualifications.
  - The response is parsed as JSON.
- **Why:**
  - Identifies and rewards relevant experience and education.

### 3. Gemini LLM Feedback
- **How:**
  - The resume and job description are sent to Gemini with a prompt asking for:
    - **Strengths**
    - **Weaknesses**
    - **Recommendations**
  - The response is parsed as JSON (with robust extraction and retry logic).
- **Why:**
  - Provides advanced, AI-powered, context-aware feedback on the resume.

### 4. Scoring Formula
The final score is a **weighted sum** of several components:

| Component                | Calculation/Weighting                                 | Max Points |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Semantic Similarity**  | `normalizedSimilarity * 50`                          | 50         |
| **Category Match**       | `categoryMatch * 10` (number of times the selected category appears in roles) | 10 per match |
| **Degrees**              | `Math.min(degrees.length * 5, 15)`                   | 15         |
| **Organizations**        | `Math.min(orgs.length * 2, 10)`                      | 10         |
| **Gemini Feedback**      | `strengths.length * 5 - weaknesses.length * 3`       | variable   |

- **All components are summed.**
- The final score is **clamped to the 0‚Äì100 range**.

#### Example Calculation
Suppose:
- Semantic similarity = 0.8 ‚Üí 0.8 * 50 = 40
- Category appears 1 time in roles ‚Üí 1 * 10 = 10
- 2 degrees ‚Üí 2 * 5 = 10
- 3 organizations ‚Üí 3 * 2 = 6
- 2 strengths, 1 weakness ‚Üí 2 * 5 - 1 * 3 = 7

**Total score:** 40 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 7 = 73

### 5. Error Handling & Robustness
- If any step fails (e.g., Gemini returns invalid JSON, or is overloaded), the system retries up to 5 times.
- If all retries fail, a user-friendly error message is returned.
- All parsing and AI calls are wrapped in try/catch blocks.

### Why This Approach?
- **Holistic:** Combines semantic matching, entity extraction, and LLM feedback.
- **Context-aware:** Goes beyond keyword matching to understand the actual fit.
- **Actionable:** Provides not just a score, but also strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations.
